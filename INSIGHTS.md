# 📌 Key Insights — Revenue & Profitability Analysis

## Overall Performance
- Revenue does not follow a stable upward trend throughout the year, reaching a peak in March and a trough in August, suggesting seasonality or uneven transaction activity.
- Gross margin remains relatively stable over time, fluctuating between 46% and 54%, which indicates a consistent pricing model and cost structure despite revenue volatility.

## Product-Level Insights
- Loans are the primary driver of both revenue and gross profit by a wide margin. They also exhibit one of the highest gross margins (≈51%), tied with Payments.
- FX transactions deliver stable margins and rank second in terms of revenue contribution, indicating a balanced mix of volume and profitability.
- Cards contribute marginally to both revenue and profit and display lower margins compared to other products.

## Segment Contribution
- SME customers represent the largest share of total revenue (approximately 41%), making them the main volume driver.
- Gross margins are broadly consistent across segments (around 50%), suggesting limited differentiation in pricing or cost-to-serve by segment.

## Business Implications
- Revenue volatility across the year suggests potential exposure to seasonality, highlighting the value of monitoring monthly performance rather than relying on annual aggregates.
- Given their strong contribution to both revenue and profit, **Loans** should remain a strategic focus for growth and optimization efforts.
- The relatively low contribution of **Cards** may warrant a review of pricing, cost structure, or strategic role.
- Since margins are similar across segments, profitability differences are primarily driven by **volume mix rather than margin differentiation**, indicating that segment-level growth strategies may be more impactful than pricing changes.
